 The gap is closed due to initial settings.                              
 *WARNING*: The geometric gap/penetration may be too large.  Increase    
 pinball radius if it is a true geometric gap/penetration.  Decrease     
 pinball if it is a false one.                                           
 *WARNING*: The initial penetration/gap is relatively large.  Bonded/no  
 separation option may cause an accuracy issue.  Switch to MPC           
 algorithm or you may use the CNCHECK,ADJUST/MORPH command to move the   
 contact nodes towards the target surface.

 The Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the in-core memory     
 mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to      
 avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most often        
 results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if      
 enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver      
 data.
